# Deploying the Gmail Add-on

1) Open `gmail-addons/` in Google Apps Script (File → New → Project, then paste files).
2) Update `BACKEND` URL if your API is public or behind a gateway.
3) Deploy as a Workspace Add-on (test deployment for your account/domain first).
4) You may need OAuth verification for broad distribution and to use add-on scopes.
